I've been working hard at my running and it is starting to pay off.  I ran a three mile speed workout this morning in 24:03.  That works out to a projected 25 minute 5K.  My best 5K last year was 27:16.  The run this morning was a stiff pace, but not nearly as fast as I would have done in a race.  It is great to be making progress and not have my back hurting all the time.  I'm running the Freedom Festival Run on July 4th and hope to get under 23 minutes.
