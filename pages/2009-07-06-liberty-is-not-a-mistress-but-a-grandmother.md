Jeff Lindsay writes a great poem on liberty, its fragile nature, and the continuing care it needs.


<a href="http://mormanity.blogspot.com/2009/07/liberty-is-not-mistress-but-grandmother.html"><blockquote>Liberty is not a young mistress:
Convenient, alluring, fragrant skin
Glistening even in the darkest shadows...</blockquote></a>
