I like my comics as much as the next person, but I'm lazy and don't want to have to go searching for them.   Darkgate Comic Slurper  provides a RSS feed that works great, but it is a pain to configure.  Plus, if I want to unsubscribe from one comic, I need to go back and start over again.  So, with a little magic in the text editor, I've created a opml file with separate feeds for every one of the comics Darkgate provides.  Simply open the attached file in your feed reader of choice and enjoy.
