 My family had a discussion a while back about good options to track a personal library. We did not find any good options. Since then, a number of good-looking web applications have become available. They allow a user to track and rate books. They are 

*  http://www.shelfari.com 
*  http://www.goodreads.com/ 
*  http://www.librarything.com/ 
*  http://books.google.com/ 

   
 What I find missing from these applications is a recommendation system that learns from my bookshelf and ratings to offer suggestions about other books I might like. There are a couple websites that attempt to do this, but they all have some fatal flaw that makes them unusable.

 For now, Amazon seems like the best place to get recommendations. It isn&rsquo;t optimized for tracking a library, but would do well enough.
