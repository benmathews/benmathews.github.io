<p>My family had a discussion a while back about good options to track a personal library.&nbsp;We did not find any good options.&nbsp;Since then, a number of good-looking web applications have become available.&nbsp;They allow a user to track and rate books.&nbsp;They are</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.shelfari.com/">http://www.shelfari.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">http://www.goodreads.com/</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.librarything.com/">http://www.librarything.com/</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://books.google.com/">http://books.google.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>What I find missing from these applications is a recommendation system that learns from my bookshelf and ratings to offer suggestions about other books I might like.&nbsp;There are a couple websites that attempt to do this, but they all have some fatal flaw that makes them unusable.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

    <li><a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">http://www.allconsuming.net/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For now, Amazon seems like the best place to get recommendations.&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t optimized for tracking a library, but would do well enough.</p>
