This article was so poorly conceived I had to write something up.  Franchuk somehow forgets that the number of possessions a player uses affects the number of times he is fouled. A far better metric is Free Throw Rate, or the Free Throws Made per Field Goal Attempt. Using this metric, Jimmer is far far from the top. Throwing out a couple numbers.

|FT/FG|Name|Year|School|
|---------------|----|----|------|
|100.44|Derrick Williams|So|Arizona|
|94.76|Travis Franklin|Sr|Colorado State|
|86.11|Tristan Thompson|Fr|Texas|

Nationally, Jimmer isn't in the top 100. Looking at the MWC only, he is 17th.
|Rank|FT/FG|Name|Year|School|
|----|-----|----|----|------|
|1|94.76|Travis Franklin|Sr|Colorado State|
|2|72.5|Dairese Gary|Sr|New Mexico|
|3|59.03|Djibril Thiam|Sr|Wyoming|
|4|57.29|Kendall Williams|Fr|New Mexico|
|5|56.15|Brandon Davies|So|Brigham Young|
|6|54.87|Malcolm Thomas|Sr|San Diego State|
|7|52.43|Anthony Marshall|So|UNLV|
|8|51.35|J.R. Cadot|Jr|Texas Christian
|9|49.38|Josh Watkins|Jr|Utah|
|10|47.63|Will Clyburn|Jr|Utah|
|11|46.0|Michael Lyons|So|Air Force|
|12|44.8|Desmar Jackson|So|Wyoming|
|13|43.88|Derek Brooks|Sr|Air|Force|
|14|41.85|Andy Ogide|Sr|Colorado State|
|15|40.27|A.J. Hardeman|Jr|New Mexico|
|16|38.28|Taylor Broekhuis|So|Air Force|
|17|37.75|Jimmer Fredette|Sr|Brigham Young|

Style of play has a big impact here. A jump shooter just doesn't get fouled as much as a driver. I think we can all agree though that Jimmer does plenty of driving. Opponents are so concerned about his threes coming off a pick that he has gotten a number of fouls on jumpers also.

Also valuable is comparison to previous years.

|Year|FTR|
|-----|----|
|07-08|20.0|
|08-09|35.7|
|09-10|51.1|
|10-11|37.7|

He is being called as if he stopped driving this year and no one plays defense on him any more. Obviously this is not the case.
