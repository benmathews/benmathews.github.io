In 1998, I graduated from BYU. I'd been driving a Volvo wagon I bought for $500 after my mission. It served me well, but the prior owner's rollover left it looking like it was worth $500. As soon as I had cash in hand, I purchased a new to me 1995 Nissan Altima. It got me married, took me on lots of hikes and road trips, somehow fit three car seats, and has performed admirably for me.

Today it reached its end as I was hit while stopped at an intersection. 

RIP my Altima.

My neck is sore and the children are fine. Considering the damage to the car, we came out of it rather well.
