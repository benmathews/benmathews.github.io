<p>The weather was still a bit grey, but much drier than yesterday.&nbsp; With the Sheltons as tour guides, we visited the state capitol, cathedral, Parrots Confectionary, and a carousel.&nbsp; You can imagine which parts the children and I preferred respectively.&nbsp; The children ate enough sugar at Parrots that they were not interested in lunch a couple hours later.</p>
<p>After lunch, Cary, Tygan, Katrina, Jenalin, and I went to visit Comet, MT, an old ghost town.&nbsp; It was fairly close as ghost towns go and only a couple miles off the interstate.&nbsp; There is a great old mill and lots of homes in fairly good condition.&nbsp;</p>
