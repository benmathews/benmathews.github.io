             Touristing around Helena, visit to Comet (ghost town) 
         
     
 
 
 The weather was still a bit grey, but much drier than yesterday.  With the Sheltons as tour guides, we visited the state capitol, cathedral, Parrots Confectionary, and a carousel.  You can imagine which parts the children and I preferred respectively.  The children ate enough sugar at Parrots that they were not interested in lunch a couple hours later. 
 After lunch, Cary, Tygan, Katrina, Jenalin, and I went to visit Comet, MT, an old ghost town.  It was fairly close as ghost towns go and only a couple miles off the interstate.  There is a great old mill and lots of homes in fairly good condition.
