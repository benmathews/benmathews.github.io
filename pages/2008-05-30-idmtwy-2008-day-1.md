 We left Lehi a little after lunch.&nbsp; Our plan was to stop and smell the roses, but the children fell asleep and we hit some big thunderstorms and a steady drizzle.&nbsp; We got to Ryan Shelton's a bit after four.&nbsp; The children ran around a for a bit before we packed back into the car and visited Jodee at the hospital were she works and then went to Lava Hot Springs.&nbsp; We enjoyed ourselves to much and never quite got dinner, so we stopped at a diner on the way back home for hamburgers and shakes and finally put the children to bed at 10:30.
