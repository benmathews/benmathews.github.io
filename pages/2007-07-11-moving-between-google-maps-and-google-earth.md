Google maps just  added a new feature that it can display kml/kmz files from google earth and  export kml/kmz files for viewing in google earth.  Very cool.  Here is a hike  that Kyle and I did last month.

And using a  bookmarklet at  http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/gmaptogpx ,  I can convert google map driving directions to a gpx file for viewing in google  earth.  Try this one out of our plans for driving to Colorado.
