All sports do: 20:10 x 8 rounds, 20 seconds on 10 seconds off, all out efforts!

Run: Use a treadmill, set at 12% grade at 0-30 sec slower pace per mile than best 5k pace. Do not reduce the speed!

I didn't know what my fitness level was after being sick all last week.  I started out at 8MPH (7:30/mile) and did the first four.  After that, I started bumping them up .2 MPH/interval and finished at 9MPH.  Only the last one was truly hard.  I figure I could have done 8.5 for all of them.
