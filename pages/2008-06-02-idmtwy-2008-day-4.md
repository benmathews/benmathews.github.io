 I went for a run first thing in the morning.  My heart rate monitor was not working, so I took that as an exuse to run as hard as I could.  Stupid me, I would pay for that the next two days.  We got packed up and I cleaned all the chicken poop off the children's shoes and we drove to the Messman's in Ammon, ID.  Sonia and I spent most of the day helping Liz clean up the kitchen, living room, and a bedroom.  When Chad got home, we had a BBQ and visited the IF temple visitor's center and walked along the Snake River for Family Home Evening.
