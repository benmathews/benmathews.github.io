<p>I went for a run first thing in the morning.&nbsp; My heart rate monitor was not working, so I took that as an exuse to run as hard as I could.&nbsp; Stupid me, I would pay for that the next two days.&nbsp; We got packed up and I cleaned all the chicken poop off the children's shoes and we drove to the Messman's in Ammon, ID.&nbsp; Sonia and I spent most of the day helping Liz clean up the kitchen, living room, and a bedroom.&nbsp; When Chad got home, we had a BBQ and visited the IF temple visitor's center and walked along the Snake River for Family Home Evening.</p>
