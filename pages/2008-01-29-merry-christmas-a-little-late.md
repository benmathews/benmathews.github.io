<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Although it is a little late to wish you Merry Christmas, we love you and want to let you know how we are doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">2007 was a great year for our family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It opened with us in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Saratoga Springs</st1:city>,  <st1:state w:st="on">UT</st1:state></st1:place> rental home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After living in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:state> for a several months, we had our bearings and felt we were ready to be homeowners again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In March, we purchased a home in Lehi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sonia loves it and swears she is never moving again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a beautiful house with slate floors, remodeled kitchen (Sonia&rsquo;s favorite room), and a big backyard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">We just got settled in our new home when we took a road and camping trip to <st1:place w:st="on">Southern Utah</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We visited <st1:placename w:st="on">Zion</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">National  Park</st1:placetype> and Ben&rsquo;s Grandfather&rsquo;s home town of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Antimony</st1:place></st1:city>, UT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cold front came through with strong winds, but even with chattering teeth, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zion</st1:place></st1:city> is beautiful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Our camping trip started the busiest year of friends, family and traveling we have had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sonia&rsquo;s old friend Liz visited with her family in early June.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple days later Sonia and the children left for a three week trip to visit Ben&rsquo;s parents in Toledo, OR, old friends in Medford, OR, and Sonia&rsquo;s family and friends in Sacramento and the Bay Area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several nights of pleading from Ben, she agreed to cut her trip a couple days short and come home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ben loves working from home around his family, but it makes for a lonely time when Sonia leaves.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Sonia had a few days to unpack and get the laundry done before her parents, Maria, Andrei, and Rebecca joined us over the Fourth of July week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We watched the giant Freedom Festival parade in <st1:city w:st="on">Provo</st1:city>, took them up <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Provo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Canyon</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and visited together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">The <em style="">next</em> week, Sonia&rsquo;s girlfriends, Blanca, Jennie, and Kellie from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Medford</st1:city>,  <st1:state w:st="on">OR</st1:state></st1:place> visited for a couple days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have much more energy than we do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Our third house guest for the month was Sonia&rsquo;s sister Elena who came to visit us and attend a college reunion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">We have a goal to explore the different states.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben served his LDS mission in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:state> 12 years ago and had not been back since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In August, we set off for a week and a half touring through <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We visited three national parks, <st1:city w:st="on">Colorado Springs</st1:city>, and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were able to spend time with old friends, the <st1:city w:st="on">Billings</st1:city> who we knew from our single days in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San   Jose</st1:place></st1:city> and the Boyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paul Boyer was Ben&rsquo;s high school cross-country coach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was wonderful to see old friends and influences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Despite all the adventures in prior months, we scheduled one last camping trip for Labor Day weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it came time to pack up the van, neither of us could stir the energy to do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, we went for a little hike, cooked dinner and played around the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">American</st1:placename>  <st1:placename w:st="on">Fork</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">River</st1:placetype></st1:place> until bedtime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">Ben&rsquo;s parents visited <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Utah</st1:state></st1:place> for Thanksgiving and stayed with us as our final house-guests for the year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shared them around with Ben&rsquo;s sister and Grandmother and celebrated Thanksgiving with a big crowd of Mathews at Libbey&rsquo;s home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">We celebrated the New Year in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:state> with the Burymski clan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was fun to line up three pregnant sisters, play in the snow, and reconnect with Sonia&rsquo;s family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0.25in; text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;">We wish you all a happy and prosperous 2008.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
