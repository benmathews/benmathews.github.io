  Friends and Family,    
  Although it is a little late to wish you Merry Christmas, we love you and want to let you know how we are doing.    
  2007 was a great year for our family.    It opened with us in a   Saratoga Springs ,   UT   rental home.    After living in   Utah   for a several months, we had our bearings and felt we were ready to be homeowners again.    In March, we purchased a home in Lehi.    Sonia loves it and swears she is never moving again.    It is a beautiful house with slate floors, remodeled kitchen (Sonia&rsquo;s favorite room), and a big backyard.     
  We just got settled in our new home when we took a road and camping trip to  Southern Utah .    We visited  Zion   National  Park  and Ben&rsquo;s Grandfather&rsquo;s home town of   Antimony  , UT.    A cold front came through with strong winds, but even with chattering teeth,   Zion   is beautiful.    
  Our camping trip started the busiest year of friends, family and traveling we have had.    Sonia&rsquo;s old friend Liz visited with her family in early June.    A couple days later Sonia and the children left for a three week trip to visit Ben&rsquo;s parents in Toledo, OR, old friends in Medford, OR, and Sonia&rsquo;s family and friends in Sacramento and the Bay Area.    After several nights of pleading from Ben, she agreed to cut her trip a couple days short and come home.    (Ben loves working from home around his family, but it makes for a lonely time when Sonia leaves.)    
  Sonia had a few days to unpack and get the laundry done before her parents, Maria, Andrei, and Rebecca joined us over the Fourth of July week.    We watched the giant Freedom Festival parade in  Provo , took them up   Provo   Canyon  , and visited together.    
  The  next  week, Sonia&rsquo;s girlfriends, Blanca, Jennie, and Kellie from   Medford ,   OR   visited for a couple days.    They have much more energy than we do.    
  Our third house guest for the month was Sonia&rsquo;s sister Elena who came to visit us and attend a college reunion.    
  We have a goal to explore the different states.    Ben served his LDS mission in   Colorado   12 years ago and had not been back since.    In August, we set off for a week and a half touring through   Colorado  .    We visited three national parks,  Colorado Springs , and   Denver  .    We were able to spend time with old friends, the  Billings  who we knew from our single days in   San   Jose   and the Boyers.    Paul Boyer was Ben&rsquo;s high school cross-country coach.    It was wonderful to see old friends and influences.    
  Despite all the adventures in prior months, we scheduled one last camping trip for Labor Day weekend.    When it came time to pack up the van, neither of us could stir the energy to do it.    Instead, we went for a little hike, cooked dinner and played around the   American    Fork   River   until bedtime.    
  Ben&rsquo;s parents visited   Utah   for Thanksgiving and stayed with us as our final house-guests for the year.    We shared them around with Ben&rsquo;s sister and Grandmother and celebrated Thanksgiving with a big crowd of Mathews at Libbey&rsquo;s home.    
  We celebrated the New Year in   California   with the Burymski clan.    It was fun to line up three pregnant sisters, play in the snow, and reconnect with Sonia&rsquo;s family.    
  We wish you all a happy and prosperous 2008.
