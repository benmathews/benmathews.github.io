 I am responsible for occasionally teaching a group of men at church.  Last Sunday was my turn.  I prepared a lesson on fatherhood and leading or presiding in the home.  The foundation of my lesson was based on a portion of  The Family: A Proclamation to the World  that reads &ldquo;By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.&rdquo;  I used for source material the scriptures,  Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family , and  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families . 
   
 My notes (rough as they are) are below 
 
     
     Equal partnership/sacred 	responsibility 
     
         
         Adam  &amp; Eve &ndash; 		interdependence &amp; equality 
        
         
         Equality, not hierarchy 
        
         
         Oneness 
        
     
    
     
     Sacred responsibility of a father 
     
         
         preside 
        
         
         provide 
        
     
    
     
      DC 	121:39-43  &ndash; no power or influence 
    
     
      Mark 	9:35  &ndash; first shall be last 
    
     
     Principle centered family 	leadership 
     
         
         Modeling 
        
         
         Mentoring 
        
         
         Organizing 
        
         
         Teaching 
        
     
    
     
     important versus urgent 
    
     
     mistakes 
    
 
   
 It is always a good sign when the material generates discussion, but that left me without time to adequately explore the last couple points.  There was a good spirit and hopefully everyone took away from the class a reminder how important fatherhood is and some tools to be good at it
