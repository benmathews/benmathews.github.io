<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I am responsible for occasionally teaching a group of men at church.  Last Sunday was my turn.  I prepared a lesson on fatherhood and leading or presiding in the home.  The foundation of my lesson was based on a portion of <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a> that reads &ldquo;By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.&rdquo;  I used for source material the scriptures, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strengthening-Our-Families-Depth-Proclamation/dp/1573458244/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216008959&amp;sr=1-1">Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-Families/dp/0684860082/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216008827&amp;sr=8-14">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">My notes (rough as they are) are below</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Equal partnership/sacred 	responsibility</p>
    <ol>
        <li>

    <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">important versus urgent</p>
    </li>

    </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It is always a good sign when the material generates discussion, but that left me without time to adequately explore the last couple points.  There was a good spirit and hopefully everyone took away from the class a reminder how important fatherhood is and some tools to be good at it</p>
