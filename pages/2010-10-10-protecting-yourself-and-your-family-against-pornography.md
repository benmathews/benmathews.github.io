<h2>Lesson Notes</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>Is your wife beautiful?</P>
<P>If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or
praiseworthy, we seek after these things</P>
<h3>Satan's counterfeit</h3>
<P>Anything the Lord gives us that is beautiful or worthwhile, Satan
counterfeits</P>
<P>Why is lust such a deadly sin? Well, in addition to the completely
Spirit-destroying impact it has upon our souls, I think it is a sin
because it defiles the highest and holiest relationship God gives us
in mortality&mdash;the love that a man and a woman have for each
other and the desire that couple has to bring children into a family
intended to be forever. Someone said once that true love must include
the idea of permanence. True love endures. But lust changes as
quickly as it can turn a pornographic page or glance at yet another
potential object for gratification walking by, male or female. True
love we are absolutely giddy about&mdash;as I am about Sister
Holland; we shout it from the housetops. But lust is characterized by
shame and stealth and is almost pathologically clandestine&mdash;the
later and darker the hour the better, with a double-bolted door just
in case. Love makes us instinctively reach out to God and other
people. Lust, on the other hand, is anything but godly and celebrates
self-indulgence. Love comes with open hands and open heart; lust
comes with only an open appetite.  - Elder Jeffery R. Holland</P>
<h3>Adultery</h3>
<P >&quot;whosoever looketh on a women to
lust after her hath commited adultery with her already in his heart &quot;
Matt 5:28</P>
<P>Satan's counterfeit</P>
<P>Satan's counterfeit to love is lust.</P>
<P>Primary way he introduces us to lust is through pornography.</P>
<h3>Bishop's letter</h3>
<P >I invite you to sincerely ask yourself
during this lesson why Heavenly Father would have you hear this
lesson at this time. I know that this pervasive plague affects
everyone in these ward boundaries. Whether directly, through a family
member, a friend or neighbor, a home or visiting teaching companion,
or through our callings each of us has the important need to listen
and be taught today.</P>
<P >I testify that if you will diligently
seek the Spirit during this lesson that you will receive the guidance
and direction that Heavenly Father needs you to receive. For some of
you it may be a call to repentance, for another a whisper to your
soul to speak with a family member, or for others an idea on a Home
Teaching lesson.  
</P>
<P >I promise you that with the inspiration
of the Spirit and courage that the Lord will help you to remove
yourself and others from this trap. I promise you that he will
prepare the way before you to accomplish this important errand. -
Bishop Anthony Perkins</P>
<h3>Repentance</h3>
<h3>What is pornography</h3>
<P>Pornography - the portrayal of explicit sexual subject matter for
the purposes of sexual excitement and erotic satisfaction.</P>
<P>Doesn't help much does it?</P>
<h3>Easier way to tell</h3>
<P>Is the Holy Ghost present?</P>
<P>Does watching, reading, or listening to the material make you
appreciate, love, and cherish your wife?</P>
<P>Turn it off</P>
