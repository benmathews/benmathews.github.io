# Lesson Notes 
## Introduction 
Is your wife beautiful?
 
If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things 

## Satan's counterfeit 
 Anything the Lord gives us that is beautiful or worthwhile, Satan
counterfeits 
 Why is lust such a deadly sin? Well, in addition to the completely
Spirit-destroying impact it has upon our souls, I think it is a sin
because it defiles the highest and holiest relationship God gives us
in mortality&mdash;the love that a man and a woman have for each
other and the desire that couple has to bring children into a family
intended to be forever. Someone said once that true love must include
the idea of permanence. True love endures. But lust changes as
quickly as it can turn a pornographic page or glance at yet another
potential object for gratification walking by, male or female. True
love we are absolutely giddy about&mdash;as I am about Sister
Holland; we shout it from the housetops. But lust is characterized by
shame and stealth and is almost pathologically clandestine&mdash;the
later and darker the hour the better, with a double-bolted door just
in case. Love makes us instinctively reach out to God and other
people. Lust, on the other hand, is anything but godly and celebrates
self-indulgence. Love comes with open hands and open heart; lust
comes with only an open appetite.  - Elder Jeffery R. Holland 
 Adultery 
 &quot;whosoever looketh on a women to
lust after her hath commited adultery with her already in his heart &quot;
Matt 5:28 
 Satan's counterfeit 
 Satan's counterfeit to love is lust. 
 Primary way he introduces us to lust is through pornography. 
 Bishop's letter 
 I invite you to sincerely ask yourself
during this lesson why Heavenly Father would have you hear this
lesson at this time. I know that this pervasive plague affects
everyone in these ward boundaries. Whether directly, through a family
member, a friend or neighbor, a home or visiting teaching companion,
or through our callings each of us has the important need to listen
and be taught today. 
 I testify that if you will diligently
seek the Spirit during this lesson that you will receive the guidance
and direction that Heavenly Father needs you to receive. For some of
you it may be a call to repentance, for another a whisper to your
soul to speak with a family member, or for others an idea on a Home
Teaching lesson.  
 
 I promise you that with the inspiration
of the Spirit and courage that the Lord will help you to remove
yourself and others from this trap. I promise you that he will
prepare the way before you to accomplish this important errand. -
Bishop Anthony Perkins 
 Repentance 
 What is pornography 
 Pornography - the portrayal of explicit sexual subject matter for
the purposes of sexual excitement and erotic satisfaction. 
 Doesn't help much does it? 
 Easier way to tell 
 Is the Holy Ghost present? 
 Does watching, reading, or listening to the material make you
appreciate, love, and cherish your wife?

 Five years 
 The world will teach our children if we do not, and children are
capable of learning all the world will teach them at a very young
age. What we want them to know five years from now needs to be part
of our conversation with them today.  - Rosemary M. Wixom - Primary

 We must also act to protect those we love. Parents install alarms
to warn if their household is threatened by smoke or carbon monoxide.
We should also install protections against spiritual threats,
