<p>My wife and I debated purchasing a vacation home for a number of years.&nbsp; We eventually decided not to because we did not want to be tied to vacationing in a particular spot.&nbsp; We were concerned about the cost, but that was secondary to deciding if we really even wanted the home.&nbsp; In today's Wall Street Journal, there is an interesting <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122002210930483439.html">article</a> that talks about the financial return on a vacation home.&nbsp; The author concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="times">If you spend 9% a year and get long-term gains of 6.4%, that leaves a 2.6% gap. That's the true cost of owning your own vacation home, and a number to compare to the cost of renting a place instead.</p>
</blockquote> <blockquote>
<p class="times">Of course we're not even counting the cost of furnishings and incidentals. But then a rental is rarely as pleasant as your own place. They are also harder to get in peak season, or at short notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="times">From a quick look at MLS listings, I would need to spend at least $150,000, but more realistically, $200,000 to purchase a vacation home in Utah.&nbsp; Based on the 2.6% figure quote above, I would need to value the home at $5200/year.&nbsp; I could rent a similar home for a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="times">Every time I look at the purchase versus rent question, it comes out to be better to rent.&nbsp; Maybe I should be catching on to something.</p>
