 I have not been able to go for a hike in a while.  Yesterday, I needed to scratch the itch.  Sonia was busy until late afternoon and my normal hiking companions were unavailable, so I went for a solo, night hike.  I think the last night hike I went on was four or five years ago with Joel and some co-workers that hiked slower than expected.  The last solo hike I went on was in Oregon.  That was the one that convinced me I needed a GPS when I entered a large meadow and could not find the trail again. 
   
 My hiking book recommended Lake Blanche as a pretty and close hike.  It  was  pretty and close.  I ignored the part where it mentioned popular and steep.  I passed 40+ people on the way up and felt every one of the 2700 feet of elevation gain.  The top was close to 9000 feet and I was breathing hard to keep going. 
   
 I could not get to the trail head until 5:30 so hiked up as the sun set.  The fall colors were in full display as I hiked up between the high, narrow canyon walls.  I got a beautiful view of the Salt Lake Valley, the Salt Lake, and the setting sun beyond it all framed by the canyon walls.  I arrived at the lake at twilight and rested against a bolder for a couple minutes admiring the view before heading back down.  I was treated to the same view of Salt Lake, this time in twinkling lights as the last bits of sunlight disappeared.
