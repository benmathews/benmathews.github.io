 This was a long day, so we left early.&nbsp; I have not been to Rexburg since shortly after I graduated in 1996.&nbsp; It has changed a lot with quite a few new campus buildings and the beautiful   Rexburg   Temple  . &nbsp;  It would have been almost an hour faster to take I-15 all the way to   Helena  , but I always take the scenic route if it doesn&rsquo;t cost to much in time. &nbsp;  We also got to see the Upper and   Lower   Mesa    Falls  . &nbsp;  They were quite impressive being full of spring runoff. &nbsp;  We ate lunch another hour up the road at Harriman  State Park . &nbsp;  It is an old ranch with great views of the  Snake River  valley. &nbsp;   
 After lunch, everyone else went to sleep while I drove the rest of the way to   Helena  . &nbsp;  Carry wasn&rsquo;t home yet, but we enjoyed the children and Julianne.
