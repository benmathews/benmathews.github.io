  Last night I was reading &ldquo;  Family Wealth--Keeping It in the Family  &rdquo; book.    It suggested how complex a set of family relationships is and that drawing a chart would demonstrate the number of relationships.    I initially drew it as father being one relationships and son being another, but the graph was to dense, so I combine them.    Attached is a couple different versions.    I thought it was fun, I hope you enjoy them.
