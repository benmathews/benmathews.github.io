             Route 
             Pocatello -&gt; Rigby 
         
     
 
 I went for a great run around Pocatello in the morning and then Sheltons and us went on a picnic before we left for Rigby in the midafternoon.  We wondered around northern Rigby for a bit before finding the Horrocks home.  Chris fed us some good stir fry and then he took me shooting.  We did  sporting clays  for an hour with a 12 gauge shot gun.  Then we shot handguns and rifles for another hour until dark.  I shot 

* 12 gauge shotgun
* .22 rifle and handgun
* .40 handgun
* Glock-19 9mm
* I declined to shoot the .45 handgun
* Colt Sporter .223 (m16 civilian model)
* Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P AR15 .223 - swat type assult rifle for close combat.
