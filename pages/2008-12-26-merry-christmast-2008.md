 Dear Family and Friends, 
 
Here it is Christmas night and I haven&rsquo;t written a letter yet.  2007 was so busy that Sonia and I intentionally slowed down this year.  We still worked in a long camping trip, my brother&rsquo;s wedding, and a couple trips to California for Sonia to visit with her parents and sisters.  Our big events this year were hosting the Burymski Thanksgiving.  People keep getting married and having children and our house was filled to bursting.  Tomorrow, the Mathews will be gathering for a weekend family reunion.  Somehow, we will find a bed for everyone.  We had a great time with the Burymskis and anticipate having an equally good time with the Mathews. 
 
We had an addition to our family this year, but not the infant variety.  Andrei Burymski, Sonia&rsquo;s youngest brother moved in with us in November to work and prepare for his mission next year.  We love having him. 
 
Ben switched to a new group at work and is enjoying the challenge.  He is in the Elders Quorum Presidency at church which is rewarding, but eats up time. 
 
Sonia has worked hard on being a great mom and homemaker.  She spends her time doing a preschool with the children, reading, and family history.  She serves by teaching the Relief Society (woman&rsquo;s organization) lesson at church monthly and is the Achievement Day Leader for 8 and 9 year old girls. 
 
Katrina is 7, a smart 2nd grader who is mostly helpful and kind.  She loves school, reading and singing.  She thinks she is all grown up and wants to be independent. 
 
Samuel is 5 and an active little boy.  We aren&rsquo;t sure if he will be an engineer or an etymologist.  He loves anything machine related and bugs.  His Aunt Sallee scored big points by bringing back a giant beetle from Taiwan. 
 
Sarah is our little 3 year old angel.  She loves her parents, brother and sister and charms everyone she comes into contact with. 
 
Love Ben, Sonia, Katrina, Samuel, and Sarah
