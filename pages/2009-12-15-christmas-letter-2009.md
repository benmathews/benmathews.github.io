Dear Family and Friends,

We hope that this letter finds you and yours healthy and happy at the end of another busy year.  

2009 has been an eventful year for the Mathews…  In May Ben’s father died after years of struggling with a brain injury, colon cancer, and other ailments.  We miss him and think of Grandpa often.  Sonia’s parents moved to Utah in October.  We enjoy having them close by.

We love traveling and started off the year with a trip over Spring Break for Sonia and the children to visit her Sacramento family.  Our second trip was to Oregon in May to be with Ben’s father before he died and attend his funeral.  In July we went to Ben’s Barker family reunion.  This was Sonia’s first time attending in the nine years that we have been married.  We had a good experience and she especially enjoyed rafting down the Boise River as a family.  In October we went on this year’s big family vacation to Disneyland.  Grandma Mathews joined us.  We had an amazing time and Ben was a good sport!  

Ben’s life seems to get busier by the year.  He spends his free time developing and maintaining a family history website, exercising, gardening, fulfilling his church responsibilities, and being a dad and husband.

Sonia loves being a mother and home maker. Our children keep her busy with all of their activities.  She has lost 30 lbs. since August and really enjoys her Zumba class.  She volunteers regularly in church as a Relief Society teacher and as an Activity Day’s leader to the 8/9 year old girls.  A highlight this year was attending Women’s Conference in the spring.  She has almost completed the U.S. naturalization process.   She loves Canada, but feels her future is in the United States and wants to vote. 

Our children are growing and thriving and bring us joy.  Katrina, our eldest is eight years old and attends third grade.  This year, she has danced, swam, played soccer and sung in her school choir.  Katrina loves being active, playing with friends, cooking, baking, riding her bike, and reading.  We are proud of her accomplishments.

Samuel started kindergarten this year.  He loves socializing and is learning to read. He has been involved in All-Sports classes, swimming, and soccer.  Samuel is loving and generous.  He wants to be in charge and tries to be a good leader.

Sarah, our four year old princess, loves all the girly stuff.  She too has been involved in All–Sports, swimming, gymnastics, and dance.  She and I do a mommy-and-me preschool several times a week.  

Andrei, Sonia’s brother, has been living with us for the last year.  He works at a Japanese restaurant and will be starting school at Utah Valley University in January.  

Best Wishes,

Ben, Sonia, and Children
