Like everyone who with a couple years of using a digital camera, Iâ€™ve got a lot of pictures on my hard drive.  And with a lot of pictures, came a lot of duplicates.  Between a couple backups that got merged together and taking four pictures of each scene, I mean a LOT of duplicates.  

After a lot searching, I found <a href="http://www.visipics.info/index.php?title=Main_Page">VisiPics</a>, which identifies duplicate pictures.  It is fast and does a fantastic job identifying pictures that are identical, but also can pick out pictures that are almost the same to let you pick the best of the four poses you took.  My only complaint is that the preview of the duplicates is so small that it is hard to decide between them.  VisiPics is free and has my strong recommendation.
