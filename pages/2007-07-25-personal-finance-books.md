 My brother asked me for advice on a good book on investing.  
 Here are a collection of book reviews from personal finance bloggers that I generally agree with.  

*  The Simple Dollar 
*  Get Rich Slowly 

From about.com are these  recommendations . 
 
Of the books on these lists, I've read 

* What Color is Your Parachute?
* The Millionaire Next Door
* The Richest Man in Babylon
* How to Win Friends and Influence People
* Getting Things Done

  
Not a very good performance considering this is something I think is important.  I'd better get reading. 
 
One on investing that appears on both of the first lists is   The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing
