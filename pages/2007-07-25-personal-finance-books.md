<p>My brother asked me for advice on a good book on investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a collection of book reviews from personal finance bloggers that I generally agree with.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/05/07/26-personal-finance-books-ranked-from-best-to-worst/">The Simple Dollar</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/03/07/building-a-personal-finance-library-25-of-the-best-books-about-money/">Get Rich Slowly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From about.com are these <a href="http://financialplan.about.com/od/moneytools/l/aatpbooks.htm">recommendations</a>.<br />
<br />
Of the books on these lists, I've read</p>
<ul>
    <li>What Color is Your Parachute?</li>
    <li>The Millionaire Next Door</li>
    <li>The Richest Man in Babylon</li>
    <li>How to Win Friends and Influence People</li>
    <li>Getting Things Done</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Not a very good performance considering this is something I think is important.&nbsp; I'd better get reading.<br />
<br />
One on investing that appears on both of the first lists is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471730335/ref=nosim/foldedspaceor-20/"><strong class="sans">The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing</strong></a></p>
