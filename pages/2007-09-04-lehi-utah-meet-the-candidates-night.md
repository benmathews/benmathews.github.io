<p>I attended the meet-the-candidates night tonight and got to meet most of the candidates.&nbsp; I recently moved to Lehi, so do not have a good grasp of the issues facing Lehi, but have definite ideas about what and how government should run.</p>
<p>The candidates are listed in the order I talked with them.</p>
<h1>Candidates</h1>
<p>Lehi free press review of the candidates -</p>

<h2>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Johnny Revill (incumbent)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:jrevill@centaurprint.com">jrevill@centaurprint.com</a> &ndash; 318-9188</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I felt a personal connection with Johnny and trusted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seemed to have a good grasp of the issues and we talked about growth and his feeling that city parks were not adequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I personally feel that Lehi&rsquo;s park number and quality is good so thought this objective was out of place and a misuse of funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friend thought that he was a follower on an issue with firing the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the first candidate that I talked to, so did not quiz him in as much depth as some of the other candidates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; NO</p>
<h2>James Dixon (incumbent)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:jdixon@lehicity.com">jdixon@lehicity.com</a> &ndash; 768-4563</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">James seemed too smooth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt like he was too worried about being a politician and had a negative personal opinion of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seems to have done his homework with the planning situation in Lehi, but I disagree with most of his positions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; NO</p>
<h2>Craig Laurence</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:craig@4lehicouncil.com">craig@4lehicouncil.com</a> &ndash; 768-2867<br />
<a href="http://4lehicouncil.com/">http://4lehicouncil.com/</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A reform candidate who is running because of the current council&rsquo;s effort to unilaterally change the form of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt he has integrity and strongly agree with his platform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My only concerns with Craig is he did not look me in the eye consistently and I think he might be more concerned with being right than compromising to move in the right direction.</p>
<p>Recommendation &ndash; YES</p>
<h2>Jeffrey Ray</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:jeff@electjeffray.com">jeff@electjeffray.com</a> &ndash; 362-9993<br />
<a href="http://electjeffray.com/">http://electjeffray.com/</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I agreed with Jeff&rsquo;s positions and felt him a straight shooter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I asked him questions to expand on his platform, he often could not answer them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recommendation &ndash; a weak YES</p>
<h2>George Harris</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="mailto:george@electharris.com">george@electharris.com</a> - 407-6206<br />
<a href="http://electharris.com/">http://electharris.com/</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was quite impressed with George.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he is running out of a sense of civic responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked with him for quite a while and felt like he had a deep understanding of the issues facing Lehi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has excellent interpersonal skills and a gravity that will serve him well in dealing with others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recommendation &ndash; YES</p>
<h2>Carolyn Nelson</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style12"><a href="mailto:mail@carolynforcouncil.com">mail@carolynforcouncil.com</a><o:p></o:p></span><br />
<a href="http://www.carolynforcouncil.com/">http://www.carolynforcouncil.com/</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carolyn is a former member of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">West Jordan</st1:city></st1:place> city council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is a recent arrival in Lehi (18 months ago).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is running for city council because the fire department&rsquo;s response time is not adequate in her opinion, but I found her singularly uninformed on the issues facing the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She seemed like a great grandmother, but I saw nothing to recommend her for a position on the city council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps in five years when she understands the local situation better, my opinion might be different.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; NO</p>
<h2>Mark Johnson (incumbent)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mark is an arrogant man who is quite willing to argue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a strong proponent of city planning and feels that the government knows better than individual property owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims in his literature to be frugal, but nothing that he told me implied frugality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; NO, NO, NO</p>
<h2>Steve Roll</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was not able to talk with Steve Roll, but Mark Johnson strongly recommended him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my mind, this is a serious strike against him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; vote NO</p>
<h2>Julian Mercer</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Julian was not present.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Recommendation &ndash; NO</p>
