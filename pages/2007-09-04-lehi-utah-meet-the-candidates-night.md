 I attended the meet-the-candidates night tonight and got to meet most of the candidates.  I recently moved to Lehi, so do not have a good grasp of the issues facing Lehi, but have definite ideas about what and how government should run. 
 The candidates are listed in the order I talked with them. 
 Candidates

    Johnny Revill (incumbent) 
  jrevill@centaurprint.com  &ndash; 318-9188 
 I felt a personal connection with Johnny and trusted him.    He seemed to have a good grasp of the issues and we talked about growth and his feeling that city parks were not adequate.    I personally feel that Lehi&rsquo;s park number and quality is good so thought this objective was out of place and a misuse of funds.    A friend thought that he was a follower on an issue with firing the municipal judge.    He was the first candidate that I talked to, so did not quiz him in as much depth as some of the other candidates. 
    Recommendation &ndash; NO 
 James Dixon (incumbent) 
  jdixon@lehicity.com  &ndash; 768-4563 
 James seemed too smooth.    I felt like he was too worried about being a politician and had a negative personal opinion of him.    He seems to have done his homework with the planning situation in Lehi, but I disagree with most of his positions. 
    Recommendation &ndash; NO 
 Craig Laurence 
  craig@4lehicouncil.com  &ndash; 768-2867 
 http://4lehicouncil.com/  
 A reform candidate who is running because of the current council&rsquo;s effort to unilaterally change the form of government.    I felt he has integrity and strongly agree with his platform.    My only concerns with Craig is he did not look me in the eye consistently and I think he might be more concerned with being right than compromising to move in the right direction. 
 Recommendation &ndash; YES 
 Jeffrey Ray 
  jeff@electjeffray.com  &ndash; 362-9993 
 http://electjeffray.com/  
 I agreed with Jeff&rsquo;s positions and felt him a straight shooter.    When I asked him questions to expand on his platform, he often could not answer them. 
 Recommendation &ndash; a weak YES 
 George Harris 
  george@electharris.com  - 407-6206

 I was quite impressed with George.    He said he is running out of a sense of civic responsibility.    I talked with him for quite a while and felt like he had a deep understanding of the issues facing Lehi.    He has excellent interpersonal skills and a gravity that will serve him well in dealing with others. 
 Recommendation &ndash; YES 
 Carolyn Nelson 
   mail@carolynforcouncil.com     
 http://www.carolynforcouncil.com/  
 Carolyn is a former member of the   West Jordan   city council.    She is a recent arrival in Lehi (18 months ago).    She is running for city council because the fire department&rsquo;s response time is not adequate in her opinion, but I found her singularly uninformed on the issues facing the city.    She seemed like a great grandmother, but I saw nothing to recommend her for a position on the city council.    Perhaps in five years when she understands the local situation better, my opinion might be different. 
    Recommendation &ndash; NO 
 Mark Johnson (incumbent) 
 Mark is an arrogant man who is quite willing to argue.    He is a strong proponent of city planning and feels that the government knows better than individual property owners.    He claims in his literature to be frugal, but nothing that he told me implied frugality. 
    Recommendation &ndash; NO, NO, NO 
 Steve Roll 
 I was not able to talk with Steve Roll, but Mark Johnson strongly recommended him.    In my mind, this is a serious strike against him. 
    Recommendation &ndash; vote NO 
 Julian Mercer 
 Julian was not present. 
    Recommendation &ndash; NO
