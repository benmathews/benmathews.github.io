<p>Dear Family and Friends,<br />
<br />
Here it is Christmas night and I haven&rsquo;t written a letter yet.&nbsp; 2007 was so busy that Sonia and I intentionally slowed down this year.&nbsp; We still worked in a long camping trip, my brother&rsquo;s wedding, and a couple trips to California for Sonia to visit with her parents and sisters.&nbsp; Our big events this year were hosting the Burymski Thanksgiving.&nbsp; People keep getting married and having children and our house was filled to bursting.&nbsp; Tomorrow, the Mathews will be gathering for a weekend family reunion.&nbsp; Somehow, we will find a bed for everyone.&nbsp; We had a great time with the Burymskis and anticipate having an equally good time with the Mathews.<br />
<br />
We had an addition to our family this year, but not the infant variety.&nbsp; Andrei Burymski, Sonia&rsquo;s youngest brother moved in with us in November to work and prepare for his mission next year.&nbsp; We love having him.<br />
<br />
Ben switched to a new group at work and is enjoying the challenge.&nbsp; He is in the Elders Quorum Presidency at church which is rewarding, but eats up time.<br />
<br />
Sonia has worked hard on being a great mom and homemaker.&nbsp; She spends her time doing a preschool with the children, reading, and family history.&nbsp; She serves by teaching the Relief Society (woman&rsquo;s organization) lesson at church monthly and is the Achievement Day Leader for 8 and 9 year old girls.<br />
<br />
Katrina is 7, a smart 2nd grader who is mostly helpful and kind.&nbsp; She loves school, reading and singing.&nbsp; She thinks she is all grown up and wants to be independent.<br />
<br />
Samuel is 5 and an active little boy.&nbsp; We aren&rsquo;t sure if he will be an engineer or an etymologist.&nbsp; He loves anything machine related and bugs.&nbsp; His Aunt Sallee scored big points by bringing back a giant beetle from Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Sarah is our little 3 year old angel.&nbsp; She loves her parents, brother and sister and charms everyone she comes into contact with.<br />
<br />
Love Ben, Sonia, Katrina, Samuel, and Sarah</p>
