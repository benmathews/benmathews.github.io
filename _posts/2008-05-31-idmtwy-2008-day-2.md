<p>I went for a great run around Pocatello in the morning and then Sheltons and us went on a picnic before we left for Rigby in the midafternoon.&nbsp; We wondered around northern Rigby for a bit before finding the Horrocks home.&nbsp; Chris fed us some good stir fry and then he took me shooting.&nbsp; We did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Clays_(shooting)">sporting clays</a> for an hour with a 12 gauge shot gun.&nbsp; Then we shot handguns and rifles for another hour until dark.&nbsp; I shot</p>
<ul>
    <li>12 gauge shotgun</li>
    <li>.22 rifle and handgun</li>
    <li>.40 handgun</li>
    <li>Glock-19 9mm</li>
    <li>I declined to shoot the .45 handgun</li>
    <li>Colt Sporter .223 (m16 civilian model)</li>
    <li>Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P AR15 .223 - swat type assult rifle for close combat.</li>
