"You believe in some great practices that the team needs to follow, but you can't convince or get the team to follow them - even the simplest ones."

"If that happens to you - it's time to visit the idea that you may be lacking some core people skills, and leadership skills."

Ouch, what an indictment.  But, it is true.  If I want to make positive changes and can't lift the proverbial lantern high enough for them to see, it is my problem.  Those that I'm failing to influence don't see a problem or get frustrated.  I guess it is time for a refresher read of some of my old books on the subject.  Covey, Carnegie, etc, here I come.
