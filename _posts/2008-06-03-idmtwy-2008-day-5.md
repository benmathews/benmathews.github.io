<p>This was a long day, so we left early.&nbsp; I have not been to Rexburg since shortly after I graduated in 1996.&nbsp; It has changed a lot with quite a few new campus buildings and the beautiful <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Rexburg</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Temple</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been almost an hour faster to take I-15 all the way to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Helena</st1:place></st1:city>, but I always take the scenic route if it doesn&rsquo;t cost to much in time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also got to see the Upper and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Lower</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">Mesa</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype w:st="on">Falls</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were quite impressive being full of spring runoff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ate lunch another hour up the road at Harriman <st1:placetype w:st="on">State Park</st1:placetype>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an old ranch with great views of the <st1:place w:st="on">Snake River</st1:place> valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch, everyone else went to sleep while I drove the rest of the way to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Helena</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carry wasn&rsquo;t home yet, but we enjoyed the children and Julianne.</p>
