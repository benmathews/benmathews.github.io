I hate facebook quizzes and really don't care how you scored on the "What type of Alien are you" quiz.  I've been systematically blocking them, but it is a loosing battle.  People create them faster than I can block them.  I finally found the solution in a greasemonkey script that removes all mentions of quizzes.
