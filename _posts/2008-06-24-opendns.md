<p>I have wanted some kind of filter on my network for a long time.&nbsp; I wanted one because my children are eventually going to grow up and to protect myself.&nbsp; I looked at commercial products, but I'm cheap and none of them seemed to work that well.&nbsp; They all had to be installed on a per computer basis and could easily be worked around.&nbsp; What I really wanted was something that would sit at the gateway of my network and act as a proxy/cache/filter.&nbsp; I looked at open source options such as <a href="http://dansguardian.org/">dansgardian</a> and <a href="http://www.ipcop.org/">IPCop</a>.&nbsp; I never spent to much time on them, but they required a computer all for themselves.&nbsp; I eventually got one, but the configuration was not very simple.</p>
<p>A couple days ago, I ran across <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a><span> which I think has solved my problems.&nbsp; For my non-technical readers, computers do not have alpha-numeric addresses like <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a>.&nbsp; They have numeric addresses such as 208.157.24.487.&nbsp; A Domain Name Server (DNS) automatically translates between the word and the number version of the address.&nbsp; Usually, your ISP provides a DNS that works just fine.&nbsp; OpenDNS provides an alternative DNS that among other things includes content filtering.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Setup is quite easy.&nbsp; I simply replaced the DNS fields on my router with their address.&nbsp; I had some issues flushing the cached DNS lookups but an ipconfig /flushdns fixed that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is not a perfect solution.&nbsp; The afore mentioned IPCop would be a much stronger option, but this is easy.&nbsp; This will keep curiousity and mistakes from ending up in bad parts of the internet.</p>
