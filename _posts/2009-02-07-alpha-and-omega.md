<p>I recently purchased Jeffrey R. Holland's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/However-Long-Hard-Jeffrey-Holland/dp/1570088802" target="_blank"><em>However Long &amp; Hard The Road</em></a>, a collection of religious essays.&nbsp; In it Holland discusses Jesus Christ's statement that he is <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rev/1/8#8" target="_blank">Alpha and Omega</a>.&nbsp; I've read these scriptures and understood that Christ was stating the extent of his role.&nbsp; He was there in the beginning with God and will be involved through the end.<br />
<br />
However, I had never thought that there was any personal application to Christ's statement.&nbsp; Holland writes on the personal application</p>
<blockquote>But he ought to be Alpha and Omega in the particular as well -- our personal beginning and our individual end, that model by which we shape our journey of threescore years and ten, and the standard by which we measure it at its conclusion.<br />
<br />
In every choice we make, he ought to be our point of reckoning, our charted course, our only harbor ahead.  He should be for us individually what he is for all men collectively -- the very brackets of existence, the compass of our privilege.  We should not stray outside him.  We should not want to try.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the scriptures as a whole, there is nothing new in this insight.&nbsp; I knew that Christ should be my model and reference point.&nbsp; In spite of this, I delighted in finding a new insight into this particular scripture.</p>
