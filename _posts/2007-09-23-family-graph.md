<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Last night I was reading &ldquo;</span><span class="sans">Family Wealth--Keeping It in the Family</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">&rdquo; book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suggested how complex a set of family relationships is and that drawing a chart would demonstrate the number of relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I initially drew it as father being one relationships and son being another, but the graph was to dense, so I combine them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached is a couple different versions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was fun, I hope you enjoy them.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
