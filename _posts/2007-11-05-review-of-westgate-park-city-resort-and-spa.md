<p>I have always been curious about the time-share idea.&nbsp;At the local county fair this summer, Westgate had a booth and for $20 and a 90-minute sales pitch, I had a mini vacation.&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><font size="6">Sales Pitch</font></strong></div>
<p>Gina spent 90 minutes extolling the virtues of their property, explaining how much money it would save us over normal vacationing expenses, and touring the property.&nbsp;She was an excellent saleswoman and quickly established a rapport and a certain level of trust.&nbsp;Her math made every assumption in favor of the time-share.&nbsp;In other words, the numbers she showed us were not realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the conclusion of the presentation, she left to get her manager because &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t know what the current inventory and pricing was.&rdquo;&nbsp;In reality, I think it is good psychology to have one sales person build up the property and another deal with the nitty gritty of money.&nbsp;In addition, getting the other salesman allowed us 5-10 minutes of private time designed to allow us to talk ourselves into the purchase.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>They eventually returned and presented the offer for a one bedroom with a week every other year for $8900 down and $636 every other year of maintenance fees.&nbsp;We turned this down explaining that I am an engineer and never make snap financial decisions.&nbsp;At this point, we had to listen to a third (very slimy) salesman give us another pitch for a $399 three night stay at the Park City resort which would preserve our &ldquo;option&rdquo; to purchase the one bedroom time share at their &ldquo;special&rdquo; price.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I went in under the assumption that any real price would be available the next week if we really wanted it, so we turned everything down in favor of doing later analysis given real numbers.&nbsp;It is not as if they are going to run out of rooms, they are building a large new expansion.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><font size="6">The property</font></strong></div>
<p>They claim it is a five star resort.&nbsp;It is not.&nbsp;There is no legal definition of what a hotel star means.&nbsp;The closest to a definitive definition I could find was at <a href="http://mobiltravelguide.howstuffworks.com/hotels-channel.htm">Mobile Travel Guide</a>.&nbsp;They define a five star hotel as:</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&quot;An exceptionally distinctive luxury environment offering expanded amenities and consistently superlative service make these hotels and inns the best in the U.S. and Canada. Attention to detail and the anticipation of guests' every need are evident throughout this exclusive group of hotels.&quot;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I would characterize the Westgate Park  City as more in line with there definition of a three star hotel</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&quot;Well-appointed establishment with a full service restaurant and expanded amenities and services such as, but not limited to, room service, fitness center and optional turndown service. Many Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, and Westin hotels are established names in the Mobil Three-Star category.&quot;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>We found the hotel quite nice initially.&nbsp;I will not enumerate the nice parts of the hotel because their literature does a nice job of that.&nbsp;After our two nights stay, we found a number of flaws.&nbsp;Some of them are major and some minor, but all of them are indicative of the level of design, service and maintenance in the hotel.</p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top: 0in;">
    <li>HVAC &ndash;      Only one room (bedroom) had a vent so when we closed doors, the other      rooms got stuffy.&nbsp;The air      conditioner was severely underpowered.&nbsp;The overnight lows were in the high 20s and the air conditioner      could not keep our room cool.&nbsp;We      had to open our window for ventilation.</li>
    <li>Worn      and damaged &ndash; Our threadbare rug and damaged walls wall hinted at      maintenance problems.</li>
    <li>Bathroom      door &ndash; A poorly designed bathroom prevented the bathroom door from opening      fully.</li>
    <li>Noise &ndash;      The walls are transparent to sound.&nbsp;We could easily hear conversations in the hall and an alarm going      off in the next room.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Swimming      pool &ndash; The swimming pool is only three feet deep.</li>
    <li>Bed &ndash; The      bed was too hard.&nbsp;I could not sleep      restfully and woke up numerous times during the night because of it.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>No      exhaust fan &ndash; The bathroom had no exhaust fan, so shower humidity stayed      trapped in our room.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong><font size="6">Financial Analysis</font></strong></div>
<p>I looked at the cost effectiveness of purchasing the time-share from two perspectives.&nbsp;One, how would purchasing the time-share affect our financial picture.&nbsp;In addition, how much the time-share would really cost us?&nbsp;Neither method of analysis came back in favor of purchasing a time-share.</p>
<div><strong><font size="5">Time share vs. other vacation options</font></strong></div>
<p>I compared our current vacationing with staying in a hotel equivalent to the time-share and purchasing the time-share.&nbsp;In the first two options, I invested the 8900 at a 10% return.&nbsp;We typically stay about two nights a year in a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; hotel, which is what I based the first scenario on.&nbsp;After 10 years,</p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top: 0in;">
    <li>our      current vacationing would result in assets of $22,000</li>
    <li>staying      in equivalent motels for a week would give us assets of $6,500</li>
    <li>purchasing      the time share would use up the $8900 and cost us an additional $13000</li>
</ul>
<div><strong><font size="5">Actual Cost of Time Share</font></strong></div>
<p>Here I looked at how much the time-share costs taking into account the opportunity cost of the money being spent.&nbsp;The time-share presented to us was for one week every other year, so one week in the time share is two times the annual costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>318 - Annual share of maintenance fee<span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p><br />
32 - Lost investment income on maintenance fee<span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p><br />
890 - Lost investment income on down payment<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p><br />
1240 - Annual cost of time share<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p><br />
2480 - Cost for one week<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can rent a <strong><em>really </em></strong>nice condominium or time-share for $2400 a week.&nbsp;It would be much, much nicer than the time-share without the downsides of owning it.</p>
<div><strong><font size="6">Conclusion</font></strong></div>
<p>I would have to be crazy to own a time-share.&nbsp;Even if I could afford the cost and it fit my lifestyle, it is much cheaper to rent a condominium.</p>
