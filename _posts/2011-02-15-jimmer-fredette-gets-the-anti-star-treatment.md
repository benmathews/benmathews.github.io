This article was so poorly conceived I had to write something up.  Franchuk somehow forgets that the number of possessions a player uses affects the number of times he is fouled. A far better metric is Free Throw Rate, or the Free Throws Made per Field Goal Attempt. Using this metric, Jimmer is far far from the top. Throwing out a couple numbers.

100.44 Derrick Williams So 6-8 235 25 Arizona
94.76 Travis Franklin Sr 6-7 215 24 Colorado State
86.11 Tristan Thompson Fr 6-8 225 25 Texas

Nationally, Jimmer isn't in the top 100. Looking at the MWC only, he is 17th.
1 94.76 Travis Franklin Sr 6-7 215 24 Colorado State
2 72.5 Dairese Gary Sr 6-1 205 25 New Mexico
3 59.03 Djibril Thiam Sr 6-10 215 24 Wyoming
4 57.29 Kendall Williams Fr 6-3 170 25 New Mexico
5 56.15 Brandon Davies So 6-9 235 26 Brigham Young
6 54.87 Malcolm Thomas Sr 6-9 220 26 San Diego State
7 52.43 Anthony Marshall So 6-3 200 25 UNLV
8 51.35 J.R. Cadot Jr 6-5 195 25 Texas Christian
9 49.38 Josh Watkins Jr 6-0 200 21 Utah
10 47.63 Will Clyburn Jr 6-7 200 25 Utah
11 46.0 Michael Lyons So 6-6 190 22 Air Force
12 44.8 Desmar Jackson So 6-5 175 24 Wyoming
13 43.88 Derek Brooks Sr 6-5 200 23 Air Force
14 41.85 Andy Ogide Sr 6-9 245 24 Colorado State
15 40.27 A.J. Hardeman Jr 6-8 225 24 New Mexico
16 38.28 Taylor Broekhuis So 6-10 210 21 Air Force
17 37.75 Jimmer Fredette Sr 6-2 195 26 Brigham Young

Style of play has a big impact here. A jump shooter just doesn't get fouled as much as a driver. I think we can all agree though that Jimmer does plenty of driving. Opponents are so concerned about his threes coming off a pick that he has gotten a number of fouls on jumpers also.

Also valuable is comparison to previous years.

07-08 20.0
08-09 35.7
09-10 51.1
10-11 37.7

He is being called as if he stopped driving this year and no one plays defense on him any more. Obviously this is not the case.
