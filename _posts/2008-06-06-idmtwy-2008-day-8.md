<p>Our plan was to travel to Yellowstone and then stay at a hotel that night.&nbsp; We knew it would be a long day, but poor planning and bad weather made it much worse than we anticipated.&nbsp; The forcast was for high 30s and rain.&nbsp; It turned out to be steady wet snow.&nbsp; We had not packed the correct clothing, so the children were miserable.&nbsp; Sarah and I were the only ones that looked at most of the sights.&nbsp; We forgot when calculating driving times that the rural roads and national park have much slower speed limits.&nbsp; Yellowstone is posted at 45 and in practice was often slower than that.&nbsp; We stopped several times while people rubbernecked at bison.&nbsp; Another time, we stopped for 45 minutes for a rollover.&nbsp; It was early evening when we finally made it to Old Faithful.&nbsp; We caught the tail end of the eruption, ate some horrible pasta at the cafeteria.&nbsp; Before going past the West Entrance, I asked a ranger about road conditions.&nbsp; He assured me that they were fine, but just south of Old Faithful, the road was closed.&nbsp; We retraced our steps to and left the park at West Yellowstone.&nbsp; The only hotel room I could find was a single queen for $138.&nbsp; We pressed on thinking there would be other options.&nbsp; Rexburg was sold out due to a baseball tournement and Idaho Falls was sold out because of a convention.&nbsp; It was almost 10pm by this point, so I gave the wheel to Sonia and she drove us home arriving at 2am Saturday morning.&nbsp;</p>
